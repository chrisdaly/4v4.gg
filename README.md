  * better axis annotation
  * additional plot with all game mmr on it? Box plot?

Where to include game id and date?

Search bar for player and game id, 
Summary of different lobby types
Breakdown of player/team cards and assignment of lobbies (standard deviation)

## Improvements 
utilise public folder in "player.js" like i did in "playerprofile.js" - seems the proper way to do it
google translate account names?

Check if there's a way around ws being insecure for num in queue
Visualization for how many in game, how many searching, how many recently finished
~~Add headers in navbar for home, player, queue~~
~~Add a match page~~
add line chart for RP/MMR gain
add ping information

add standard deviation to team header, transition
