# Blog Writing Style

Technical blog writing style for 4v4.gg:

## Prose
- Concise, PG-influenced prose. No fluff.
- Sentences flow into each other; avoid stop-start staccato.
- Use colons and semicolons to connect related thoughts instead of choppy periods.
- Show, don't preach. State facts without telling the reader how to feel.

## Avoid
- Em dashes
- Rhetorical questions
- "Key insight is", "it's worth noting", "interestingly"
- Superlatives or self-congratulation ("elegant", "powerful", "simple yet effective")
- Cheesy conclusions or sign-offs
- "In the wild", "at the end of the day", or other colloquialisms

## Structure
- One clear thread: problem → why obvious solutions fail → actual solution → proof it works
- Concrete examples over abstract explanations
- If linking to background info, embed it naturally in the prose rather than calling it out
- Let visuals speak; minimal prose around them
- End when you're done. No wrap-up needed.

## Reference
See `/src/DesignLab.jsx` for the "Dots, Not Numbers" post as an example of this style.
